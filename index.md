<span>**Routematic, Bangalore - *Data Scientist*** </span>  
Routematic is an Employee Transport Management Solutions service
provider with operations across all major metro cities in India like
Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune etc.

  - Built a fleet prediction system using Random Forest Regressor
    achieving an accuracy of 92%.

  - Worked on Driver Churn Prediction to minimize driver attrition, used
    learning curve algorithm to explicitly prove that with the given
    frequency and type of data the problem cannot be solved.

  - Currently working on a project to create a graph of all the cities
    under operation using the GPS data gathered from the company’s cab
    network.

<h3><span>Internships</span></h3>

<span>**CrowdANALYTIX, Bangalore - *Data Science Intern*** </span>  
Built product classification filters for company’s AI driven product
cataloguing platform with a diverse range of categories from fashion to
home utility. Used a two step process of image and text based
classification.

  - For Image classification implemented various deep learning
    algorithms (CNNs), transfer learning etc using Tensorflow and Keras.

  - For Text classification used product’s description to find out
    patterns and match it with similar products using RegEx based
    modelling.

<span>**Robust Results Pvt. Ltd. IIT Kanpur - *Machine Learning
Intern*** </span>

  - Worked on classification problem of a 13 digit alphanumeric dataset
    using a neural network coded from scratch using numpy and pandas.

  - Created a sample course for the company’s online teaching platform
    on the topics of C, Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming
    using Java.

<h3><span>Academic Projects</span></h3>

<span>**IDC Classification using CNNs in Breast Histopathological
Images**</span>  
Trained 10 CNN architectures on the dataset and created an ensemble
model with the top 5 best performing models, achieving a precision of
97% for Non-IDC and 94% for IDC.  
Dataset : Contains a total of 277,524 images (198,738 Non-IDC and 78,786
IDC)

<span>**Data Analytics on the Indian Economy**</span>  
Studied and performed data analytics on various aspects of the Indian
Economy namely Employment, Tax, Digital Payment, GDP and Inflation.  
Data Sources : India API, World Bank, incometaxindia.gov.in, RBI,
data.gov.in, webscrapping etc.

<span>**Movie Recommendation System** </span>  
Developed a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering
and Popularity based algorithm based on user history.  
Dataset : MovieLens 100K dataset

<h3><span>Personal Projects</span></h3>

<span>**Superhero Classification from Product Images** </span>Achieved
an accuracy of 73% by implementing a simple 5 layer CNN to classify
among 12 different categories of superheroes from product images such as
t-shirts, coffee mugs, bags etc.

<span>**News Category Classification** </span> Implemented different
Machine learning algorithms to classify among 30 news categories using
headline and short description of the news and achieved maximum accuracy
of 60% using Multinomial Logistic Regression.

<span>**Happiness Type Predictor** </span> Achieved accuracy of 88% in
happiness type predictor using Naive Bayes for a dataset consisting of
60,000 text messages with six different happiness types.
